Business Requirements Document (BRD) - Image Sharing App

1. Introduction
The purpose of this BRD is to outline the business requirements for an image sharing app targeting photography enthusiasts and professionals. The app will allow users to share and discover high-quality, visually stunning images that are not found on other social media platforms. The app will differentiate itself from competitors by offering advanced editing tools, customizable filters, and a strong community aspect.

2. Scope
The app will be available on both iOS and Android platforms and will be accessible to users globally. The primary target audience is millennials and Gen Zers who are interested in photography and visual storytelling. The app will offer both a free version with limited features and a paid subscription model for access to advanced tools and features.

3. Business Requirements
3.1 User Profiles
The app will allow users to create profiles and connect with other users based on shared interests and photography styles. Users will be able to create collections of their favorite images and follow other users for inspiration and engagement.

3.2 Image Sharing
Users will be able to share their images with the community and tag them with relevant keywords for search and discovery. The app will allow for easy sharing of images on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.

3.3 Advanced Editing Tools
The app will offer a range of advanced editing tools such as color correction, white balance adjustment, exposure adjustment, and cropping. Users will also be able to add text, borders, and other creative elements to their images.

3.4 Customizable Filters
Users will be able to create and save their own custom filters, as well as choose from a range of pre-made filters that cater to various photography styles and aesthetics.

3.5 Community Features
The app will have a strong community aspect, with features such as user-generated challenges and competitions, a social feed for following other users' activity, and the ability to leave comments and engage with other users.

4. Business Goals
The primary business goals for the app are to attract a large and engaged user base, increase brand awareness and user retention, and generate revenue through the subscription model and potential advertising and sponsored content opportunities.

5. Third-party integration
The third-party service we plan to integrate with is Pixlr, a cloud-based photo editing platform that provides users with a wide range of editing and filtering tools. The integration will allow users to access Pixlr's tools directly within our app, without having to leave the platform.

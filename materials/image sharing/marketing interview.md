Marketing Company Rep: Hi, thanks for joining us today. Can you tell us about your vision for this image sharing app and how it would differentiate itself from other apps in the market?

Stakeholder: Sure, our vision for this app is to create a platform that allows users to share and discover high-quality, visually stunning images that are not found on other social media platforms. We want to focus on a more niche audience of photography enthusiasts and professionals who are looking for a platform that caters to their specific interests.

Marketing Company Rep: That's a great vision. Who is the target audience for this app and what demographics do they fall into?

Stakeholder: Our target audience is primarily millennials and Gen Zers who are interested in photography and visual storytelling. We expect a majority of our users to be between the ages of 18-35, with a 60/40 split between male and female users.

Marketing Company Rep: Interesting. Are there any specific features that you would like to see in this app that would help distinguish it from other image sharing apps?

Stakeholder: Yes, we would like to include features such as customizable filters, advanced editing tools, and the ability to organize images into collections. We also want to focus on building a strong community aspect to the app, with the ability for users to connect with each other, share tips and techniques, and participate in challenges and competitions.

Marketing Company Rep: Those are some great ideas. How would you like to monetize this app and what business model would you like to pursue (e.g. advertising, in-app purchases, subscriptions)?

Stakeholder: We're exploring a few options, but we're leaning towards a subscription-based model. We want to offer a free version of the app with limited features, and then provide additional features and tools for a monthly or annual subscription fee. We may also include some advertising and sponsored content opportunities for additional revenue streams.

Marketing Company Rep: Okay, that makes sense. What type of marketing campaigns do you envision for this app and what channels would you like to utilize (e.g. social media, influencer marketing, paid advertising)?

Stakeholder: We plan to utilize a mix of social media marketing, influencer marketing, and paid advertising to promote the app. We also want to leverage the community aspect of the app to encourage user-generated content and word-of-mouth promotion. We're still in the process of finalizing our marketing strategy, but we're excited to explore all of these channels and see what resonates with our target audience.

Marketing Company Rep: Great, thank you for sharing all of this information with us. We're excited to work with you on this project and help bring your vision for the app to life.

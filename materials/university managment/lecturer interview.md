Interviewer: Hi, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you tell me a little bit about your role here at the university?

Stakeholder: Of course, I am a senior lecturer in the Computer Science department and I am also an administrator for the department. I oversee the scheduling of classes, manage the department budget, and work with other faculty members to ensure that our curriculum is up-to-date and meeting the needs of our students.

Interviewer: Great, thank you. How do you currently manage the scheduling of classes for the department?

Stakeholder: Right now, we use a combination of spreadsheets and emails. It's not ideal, but it gets the job done. We have to manually input all of the class information and then send out emails to the students to let them know when and where their classes will be held.

Interviewer: I see. What are some of the challenges that you face with this system?

Stakeholder: Well, for one, it's time-consuming. It takes a lot of effort to input all of the class information and then send out emails to all of the students. Plus, there's always the risk of human error - someone could accidentally input the wrong information or forget to send an email, which could cause a lot of confusion for the students.

Interviewer: That makes sense. How do you think a university management application could help with these challenges?

Stakeholder: I think it could make things a lot easier and more efficient. If we could input all of the class information into the app and then have it automatically generate schedules and send out notifications to the students, that would be a huge time-saver. Plus, it would eliminate the risk of human error and make sure that all of the students have accurate information about their classes.

Interviewer: That sounds like a great solution. Are there any other features that you would like to see in a university management application?

Stakeholder: Yes, I think it would be helpful to have a way to track student progress and communicate with them more easily. Right now, we have to use a separate system for grading and feedback, and it would be nice to have everything in one place. It would also be helpful to have a way to communicate with students individually or in groups, whether it's through messaging or video conferencing.

Interviewer: Thank you, that's really helpful feedback. Is there anything else that you think would be important for us to know as we develop this application?

Stakeholder: Just that it needs to be user-friendly and easy to use. We don't want to add more complexity to our already busy schedules, so anything that can make our lives easier and more efficient would be greatly appreciated.

Interviewer: How can we generate revenue without charging the students?

Stakeholder: One potential way to generate revenue without charging the students directly is to explore partnerships and collaborations with educational service providers. For example, the university management application could integrate with textbook providers or online learning platforms, and earn a referral or partnership fee for each transaction or subscription made through the app.
